## 📦 Installation

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18  
- Python ≥ 3.9  
- PostgreSQL  
- npm / pip

### 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-heating-system.git
cd smart-heating-system
````

---

## 🔧 Backend Setup (`buildocc-bend`)

```bash
cd buildocc-bend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate         # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and configured properly.

---

## 🌐 Frontend Setup (`buildocc`)

```bash
cd buildocc
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

### ✅ Next Steps:

1. Paste this into your main `README.md`.
2. Replace:
   - `https://github.com/yourusername/smart-heating-system.git` with your actual repo URL.
   - `[your-email@example.com]` and `[LinkedIn or GitHub profile]` with your info.

Would you like me to also:
- Add badges (e.g., `Built with FastAPI`, `Deployed with Vercel`)?
- Create separate `README.md` files for the backend and frontend folders?
- Generate an image of a system architecture diagram?

Let me know and I’ll prepare it right away.
